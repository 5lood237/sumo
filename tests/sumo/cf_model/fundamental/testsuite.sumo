# - Observing breakdown requires a long road because the disturbance travels upstream and needs some time to develop
# - Krauss sigma may create a critical disturbance but also reduces density (which absorbs disturbances)
# - To increase the likelyhood of breakdown, density must be increased further (tau 0.9)
# - Simulation is free of "physical" collisions but we have to disable collision warnings for mingap violations
# - we need large disturbances to reach standstill from a high speed of ~36 (sigma=1)
