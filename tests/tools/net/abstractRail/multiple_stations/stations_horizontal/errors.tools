/home/kobo/dlr/sumo/tests/../tools/net/abstractRail.py:381: OptimizeWarning: Solving system with option 'sym_pos':False failed. This may happen occasionally, especially as the solution is approached. However, if you see this frequently, your problem may be numerically challenging. If you cannot improve the formulation, consider setting 'lstsq' to True. Consider also setting `presolve` to True, if it is not already.
